This is the README file for the PHP api

 The entry point for the api is index.php. It loads third party scripts from '/vendor/' and
 then requires all the php code files that make up the api. Finally it starts the 
 router so that when the user visits api endpoints they are directed to the correct place.
 
 The structure of the app is:
 1) The scripts in /core store constants, allow access to the database and provide helper functions
 2) Controller classes that provide CRUD operations on the various models.
 3) Model classes that retrieve/store data and contian business logic.
 4) Routes.php and pre_routes.php which govern app routings. Routing is provided by the vendor package @bramus/router
 5) Third party code resides in /vendor. The current packages as listed in composer.json are  
       i) @bramus/router
      ii) @lcobucci/jwt for JSON web token support
     iii) @lcobucci/clock required for JWT packages
      iv) @quickbooks/v3-php-sdk This is an API to the QuickBooks app provided by the owner of the application, Intuit
       v) @pear/OLE to extract information from password-protected MS Excel spreadsheets
      vi) @pear/pear required for OLE package
     vii) @phpoffice/phpspreadsheet to extract information from MS Excel spreadsheets
