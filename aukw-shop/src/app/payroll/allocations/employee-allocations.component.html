      <p>
        Employee allocations are managed by editing a recurring transaction in
        the Charity quickbooks file.
      </p>
      <p>The transaction is called "Salary Allocations - DoNotDelete".</p>
      <p>
        Before adding a new employee to the recurring transaction, ensure that
        they are listed among the employees in the QBO Payroll section. To
        complete the process, edit the new employee and add their iris payroll
        number to the Employee ID field.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not necessary to delete employees who have left the charity from
        the recurring transaction.
